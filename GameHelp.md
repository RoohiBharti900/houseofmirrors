# Welcome to the house #
The goal of the game is to light up all the Detectors in the house.

## Things you will encounter in the house ##

  * Detectors; these light up only when a light ray falls on them (ironic, huh). Usually you _can't_ move or rotate them.
  * Light sources; these emit light rays. Usually you _can't_ move or rotate them either.
  * Mirrors; these reflect all light rays incident on them
  * Partial Mirrors; these both reflect and transmit light rays.
  * Other more exotic objects (hey there should be an element of surprise, right?)

## Opening a game ##
You can go to the next or previous level by using the PAGE\_DOWN and PAGE\_UP keys respectively.

To load a game file (which is not from the default game pack), use the "Game menu" -> "Open" command.

## Moving around ##
### With the mouse ###
Select one of the objects that you fancy by **clicking** on it. Clicking the **LEFT** mouse button rotates it clock-wise while clicking with the **RIGHT** rotates it counter-clock-wise. To move an object, just **drag** it to its new location.

### With the keyboard ###
After selecting an object with the mouse, you can use **UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT** keys to move the piece. If the object can not be moved, the selection moves instead.

To rotate the object in clock-wise direction press **SPACE**, and to rotate it in counter-clock-wise direction press **ENTER**.
